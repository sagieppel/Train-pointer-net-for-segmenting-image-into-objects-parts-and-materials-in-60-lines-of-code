# Train-pointer-net-for-segmenting-image-into-objects-parts-and-materials-in-60-lines-of-code
Train pointer neural net that simage into material phases, or objects parts (could also use for panoptic and instance segmentation)

Detail on the code and instructions for how to train this code can be found here [https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi6_7Xkosf4AhVDVc0KHZDICTEQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40sagieppel%2Ftrain-pointer-net-for-segmenting-objects-parts-and-materials-in-60-lines-of-code-ca328be8cef2&usg=AOvVaw0FJmhwIDOtDLO3cOW_KY-o]

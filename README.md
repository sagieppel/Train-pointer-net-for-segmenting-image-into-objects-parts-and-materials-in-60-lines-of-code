# Train-pointer-net-for-segmenting-image-into-objects-parts-and-materials-in-60-lines-of-code
Train pointer neural net that simage into material phases, or objects parts (could also use for panoptic and instance segmentation)

Detail on the code and instructions for how to train this code can be found in (this medium post) 
[https://medium.com/@sagieppel/train-pointer-net-for-segmenting-objects-parts-and-materials-in-60-lines-of-code-ca328be8cef2]

Pretrained model can be download here [https://icedrive.net/s/Pu3FRwWN7vbPyutP9Z49C3BZG9Vg]

## Testing: 
[Download pretrain model](https://icedrive.net/s/Pu3FRwWN7vbPyutP9Z49C3BZG9Vg) into the main code script (or train yourself), run the test script.

## Dependencies:
You will also need to install Pytorch for training and OpenCV for image reading.

OpenCV can be installed using:

pip install opencv-python
